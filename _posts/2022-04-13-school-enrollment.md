The [school enrollment](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/07/us/covid-kindergarten-enrollment.html) project was a collaboration between Big Local News and the New York Times. The [Big Local News](https://biglocalnews.org/#/about) team collected data at the state, district and local levels to figure out which schools were lacking in student enrollment. For this project, I mainly vetted data and with the help of co-workers standardized it/prepared it for comparisons at different levels.
