The School Enrollment Project was a collaboration between Big Local News and the New York Times to quantify COVID-19â€™s impact on schools throughout the country. The [Big Local News](https://biglocalnews.org/#/about) team collected data at the state, district and local levels from more than 30 states. 

I played a strong role in the project; helping to vet, standardize and prepare the data for comparisons at different levels. The effort resulted in an article that appeared on the front page of the [Sunday New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/07/us/covid-kindergarten-enrollment.html), which documented disproportionate kindergarten enrollment declines in lower-income neighborhoods. The data also contributed to an [academic paper](https://www.nber.org/papers/w29156) from the Center for Education Research at Stanford.
