Remember 2020? It was the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, a world-disrupting disaster that changed every aspect of life as we knew it. During that time, people were losing jobs due to restrictions and closures. Big Local News started collecting WARN Notices (Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification), which are mass layoff notices, for any states where we could find them. That summer, I led the charge in building over 20 scrapers to capture the extent of the layoffs.

This work eventually led to a project in Cheryl Phillips’ Big Local Journalism class. During the class, Big Local News staff and Stanford students reported on the impact of the eviction moratorium and how the mass layoffs exacerbated people’s fears of ending up unhoused.

Here’s my [analysis](https://github.com/biglocalnews/warn-california-analysis) of the WARN Notices in California and the [story](https://localnewsmatters.org/2021/03/15/job-layoffs-spur-housing-struggles-in-state-even-as-evictions-remain-on-hold/) we published.

The WARN Notices project has evolved significantly since the first few scrapers were written. We've gained more open source contributions after I helped start the scraping operation and worked to standardize the code base. Take a look at the [open source warn-scraper](https://github.com/biglocalnews/warn-scraper), you may find mass layoffs in your location to report on!
