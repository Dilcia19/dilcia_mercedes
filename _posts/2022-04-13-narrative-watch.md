Narrative Watch is a project out of Stanford’s [Big Local News](https://biglocalnews.org/#/about), in partnership with the [Sterling Lab](https://engineering.stanford.edu/magazine/starling-lab-announces-its-inaugural-journalism-fellows?s=09), where we are looking for patterns in police use of force and misconduct cases. This project is a smaller, discrete project created from the larger CLEAN (Community Law Enforcement Accountability Network) effort.

As part of this project, I’m reporting, doing data analysis and working with machine learning models to sort through and learn from our large quantity of text data.
