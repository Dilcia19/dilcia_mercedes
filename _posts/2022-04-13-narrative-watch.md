Narrative Watch is a project out of Stanford’s [Big Local News](https://biglocalnews.org/#/about), in partnership with the [Starling Lab](https://engineering.stanford.edu/magazine/starling-lab-announces-its-inaugural-journalism-fellows?s=09), where we are looking for patterns in police use-of-force and misconduct records. This project is a smaller, discrete project created from the larger CLEAN (Community Law Enforcement Accountability Network) effort.

When California passed SB1421, making use of force records available to the public, newsrooms were faced with unprecedented opportunities and challenges. Opportunities to report on serious force and misconduct with documents from police departments were now available. But before there could be any stories - tens of thousands of pages of text, images, audio and video files had to be processed; hence the challenges.

Leaders at Stanford's [Big Local](https://biglocalnews.org/#/about), the [California Reporting Project](https://projects.scpr.org/california-reporting-project/), the [Full Disclosure Project](https://www.nacdl.org/Landing/FullDisclosureProject), and UC Berkeley's [Investigative Reporting Program](https://journalism.berkeley.edu/programs/mj/investigative-reporting/) and [Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) came together to create CLEAN.

Narrative Watch, as a project within CLEAN, is making use of these large amounts of records to find patterns and discover stories on use-of-force.

As part of this project, I’m reporting, making record requests, data cleaning, doing data analysis and working with machine learning models to sort through and learn from our large quantity of text data.
