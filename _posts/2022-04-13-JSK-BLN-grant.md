The [JSK-BLN Data Reporting Grants](https://jsk.stanford.edu/news/2020/jsk-and-big-local-news-award-191500-worldwide-to-data-journalism-projects/) helped newsrooms go beyond the daily coverage of new COVID-19 cases and spend more time investigating the pandemic’s impact on vulnerable communities. Big Local News and the John S. Knight Journalism Fellowships, along with funding from the Google News Initiative, provided support, training and expertise that allowed grant recipients to investigate the myriad of ways COVID-19 was changing every aspect of life. With the grants, 11 news organizations from around the world received funding ranging from $8,000 to $21,000 to explore a data-driven story related to the pandemic. 

Two organizations that I mentored were [Flint Beat](https://flintbeat.com/) and [Salud Con Lupa](https://saludconlupa.com/). Initially, Flint Beat wanted to analyze racial disparities using case and death rates. However, after I guided them through rigorous data cleaning and validation, they soon realized the racial data was spotty and unreliable. Without solid data, we could not identify where COVID-19’s impact was being felt most among different communities. 

For Salud Con Lupa, I provided suggestions about the data collection and guided the direction  of some of their reporting. In the early stages, I helped reporters focus the project as they worked to find and understand the various data sources. 

The stories came out great. [Flint Beat](https://flintbeat.com/when-race-data-goes-missing-how-do-health-leaders-combat-covid-racial-disparities-in-flint/) exposed how county officials were not tracking race in their COVID case data and were not able to spot racial disparities in the community. [Salud Con Lupa](https://saludconlupa.com/series/el-otro-peru/) highlighted COVID-19’s impact on remote, indigenous communities and how health services were not easy to come by. They created an [interactive map](https://saludconlupa.com/series/el-otro-peru/datos/) showing the factors that lead to worse health outcomes.

The JSK-BLN Data Reporting Grants produced many great data-driven stories. Learn about all of them [here](https://biglocalnews.org/posts/2022/04/11/covid-grant-stories.html).
