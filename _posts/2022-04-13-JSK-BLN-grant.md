The JSK-BLN Data reporting grants were created to help newsrooms report on the ways COVID-19 impacted communities aside from the rise and fall in new coronavirus cases. We realized newsrooms were so preoccupied with reporting the daily numbers, that there was little time and funding to investigate the other ways COVID-19 was changing communities. With the grants, 11 news organizations got funding to explore COVID-19’s impact in their communities.

I specifically worked with Flint Beat and Salud Con Lupa to help them produce their data stories. For both projects, Big Local News provided guidance on how to execute tricky parts of their analysis and advice on how to bring the projects to completion. The stories came out great; Flint Beat wrote about the issue of missing data; Salud Con Lupa wrote about COVID-19’s impact on remote, indigenous communities and how health services were not easy to come by.
