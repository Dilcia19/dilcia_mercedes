  Hi üëãüèæ My name is Dilcia Mercedes (they/them), and I am a data journalist/developer.  A little about myself, I have worked at Big Local News since 2019. I joined the team as a data journalist. While at Big Local, I worked on sharpening my programming and reporting skills.
  <br>
  <br>
  In my time at Big Local News, I gained experience in managing and executing large data-driven projects; I guided new journalism students in exploring data angles for their own projects; I immersed myself in the world of data and helped other newsrooms publish underreported stories, all while closing out a few of my own.
  <br>
  <br>
  On any given day, I could be working on a scraper, analyzing data for a story, or building data pipelines and internal tools. Moving forward, I am interested in getting deeper into creating tools, building news apps, and making data visualizations.
