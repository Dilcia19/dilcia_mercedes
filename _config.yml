  Hi üëãüèæ My name is Dilcia Mercedes (they/them), and I am a data journalist/developer interested in creating stories from data and building newsroom tools. A little about myself, I have worked at Big Local News since 2019. I joined the team as a data journalist, and since then have sharpened my programming and reporting skills. 
  <br>
  <br>
  In my time at Big Local News, I gained experience in managing and executing large data-driven projects; I learned to guide new journalism students in exploring data angles for their own projects; I immersed myself in the world of data and got to help other newsrooms report stories that they may have not published otherwise, all while closing out a few of my own.
  <br>
  <br>
  On any given day, I could be working on a scraper, analyzing data for a story, or building data pipelines and internal tools to streamline our workflows. Moving forward, I am interested in getting deeper into building tools and news apps, ETL, and data analysis.
